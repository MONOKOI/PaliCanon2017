What Do Religions Do Pragmatically or Programmatically?

First, they do not brainwash anyone. We are all born surrounded by overt and covert advertising or even political forms of everyday brainwashing. Let that go. 

Religions tell morals to stories they tell. The stories have more than one overlapping moral to them.

Those shared words resift our own memories like combs. They don't infect you. Christians would say we are grapes and sharing Scripture is our yeast. The fizzy alcohol makes us palatable and immune to critters in our own functioning.

Religions do not make you forget anything. They help you remember.

Christians set a big calendar. Buddhists keep a few different calendars and still remember time before and after the Buddha's birth. 

Religions tie us back to history. Our stories make more sense in the context of longer stories.

Of odd necessities, we reify or proclaim new Era's. We reified Dark Ages And Proclaimed Enlightened Dictatorship.

Religious and now academic Histories tell much longer, very continuous, troubled, disappointed and sadder tales of celestial Eons Or Eras.

Eternity is a more modern abstraction.

Religions make us question and repurpose all our diverse Influences. 

Influence is a special word in Buddhist scripture. Influence means things we eat, drink, drive, smoke or hide in addition to see, hear, touch, read, write and remember.

Religions will not ask you to crash diet. They ask you to cost less. 

Religions will not ask you to injure yourself ice climbing. They ask you to cost less.

Religions will nto ask you to makeover your wardrobe. They ask you to cost less.

Religions promote freedom first via savings. They save you from debts that might predetermines bad pathways with bad company through life.

Restaurants on tight budgets might take on debt in August before seasonal Fall and Winter customers. That is not the same as personal debt for school or a car. Those debts are untargeted, depreciate and lead nowhere obvious.

Freedom is writing your own story. Religions provide editors and even ferry boat rowers to other places to write your story.

Everyone not alone in a wilderness writes each other's stories. 

Letters, books, newspapers, blueprints and now videos or software let us share abstractions of those stories at amazing geographic scales.
