What Do Religions Do Pragmatically or Programmatically?

Religions do not brainwash anyone. 

We are all born surrounded by overt and covert advertising, fictions and even political forms of everyday brainwashing. 

Add in old wives tales and repeated false rumors to fog our veils of ignorance. 

Don't enter those battles. See them on history and marketing library shelves. Let that go. 

Religions tell morals to stories they tell. 

Scriptural stories have more than one overlapping moral to them.

That multifaceted jewel like poetic impact in human mind is important and on purpose.

Secular philosophy converts gather to big scriptural traditions.

Later secular philosophies evolve around them and then reinterpret them.

That is all normal and de facto by design. 

Designs are not fictions.

Designs are strategic planning artifacts.

Designs work differently at group, bureuacracy, civilization, family and individual scales.

Although we inherit scriptures socially, we individually share words that resift, sort and reprioritize our own memories like combs. 

Words don't infect you exactly. 

Christians might say we are born grapes. Sharing Scripture is our yeast. The fizzy alcohol makes us palatable and immune to critters in our own free functioning.

Religions do not make you forget anything. They help us remember.

Christians set a big calendar. 

Buddhists keep a few different calendars and still remember time before and after the Buddha's birth. 

Religions tie us back to history. 

Our family, friend, travel and place stories make more sense in the context of longer stories over greater distances.

That is not a controversial claim to any historian, geologist, geographer, scientist or philosopher.

Of odd necessities, we reify or proclaim new Era's. We know ourselves reifying Dark Ages And proclaiming Enlightened Dictatorship.

Religious and now academic Histories tell much longer, very continuous, troubled, disappointed and sadder tales of celestial Eons Or Eras.

Eternity is a more modern abstraction.

Even Buddha abstracted finite characterizations of long Time periods.

Jesus or his retellers said to look to the celestial Age Of Aquarius.

Religions suggest quality criteria against which to measure group, civilization and individual progress.

Religions make us question and repurpose all our diverse Influences. 

That can have social consequences against local habits and customs everywhere.

TV, public schools and national brands do not obviate vastly different local realizations of these institutions or tools.

Influences are local or imported by definition. We pick from what we get.

Influence is a special word in Buddhist scripture. 

Influence means things we eat, drink, drive, smoke or hide in addition to see, hear, touch, read, write and remember.

You might remember a fun movie fun a different way.

You might remember a rape evil a different way.

Religions will not ask you to crash diet. They ask you to cost less. 

Religions will not ask you to injure yourself ice climbing. They ask you to cost less.

Religions will nto ask you to makeover your wardrobe. They ask you to cost less.

Religions promote freedom first via savings. 

Religions warn against debt slavery. 

Religions save people from debts that might predetermine bad pathways with bad company through real lives.

Restaurants on tight budgets might take on debt in August before seasonal Fall and Winter customers. 

Those unsecured cashflow debts are not the same as personal debt for school or a car. 

Most personal debts are untargeted, buy depreciating assets and lead nowhere obvious.

Freedom is writing your own story. 

Religions seed your language.

All great writers know their scriptures.

Good religious local communities provide editors and even ferry boat rowers to other places to write your story.

Everyone not alone in a wilderness writes each other's stories. 

Letters, books, newspapers, blueprints and now videos or software let us share abstractions of those stories at amazing geographic scales.

Religions are local. You sample what you get.

You get answers to questions you ask.

Good religious folks will ask you lots of questions.

Good religious folks will ask to stay and help you to leave.

Religions are not selling anything. 

Good religions house dialogs and teach people how to speak them.

Good religious communities offer finer grained information than muted books or newspapers.

Reading complex religious scripture requires filling in many narrative and historical blanks.

Religious communities fill in communicative blanks in each other.

Religious communties work best for active, intelligent and learned people not goofing off.
