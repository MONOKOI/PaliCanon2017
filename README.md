_Essays On Ecumenical Classical Roads Accessing Buddha Dhamma_

I arranged a Woodley Park, DC Pali Canon Meetup.com reading group May, 2017. This group reads through the English language translator Bikkhu Bodhi's _In The Buddha's Words_ anthology with Gombrich's _What The Buddha Thought_ and Stoic philosophy represented by Marcus Aurelius' _Meditations_ And Epictetus' _Enchiridion_. 

The last selection was studied by centuries of early Greek Or Latin literate Christian converts With _Jesus_ Substituted For _Socrates_. Ashoka's Empire left personnel records of Greek officials and citizens, and centuries later St. Paul's Road to Damascus knew caravansery inns run by Buddhist Syriac monks. 

An overt thesis we explore is that lived Eurasian literate traditions overlap between Philosophical Schools traveling the Silk Road. They shared letters, lectures, dialogs, manuscripts, logic and numeric methods between Asia, the Indian Subcontinent and later Latinized Europe. Centuries later Voltaire and Hume also reaccessed Buddhist scriptures newly. These high literacy traditions form an overlapping _Heartwood_ Or _Ganges_ unbroken intellectual tradition that Global Christians, Muslims and Buddhists today inherit. 

Another overt thesis is that _Dhamma_ and _Religiosa_ both refer overtly and properly to monastic leadership ways of life traditions and lived strategic philosophies. In that light, Buddhist and Christian narrative moral stories and principled ethics reveal myth referring but newly myth freed traditions gathering philosophical schools like tornadoes then applied to new architectures for civilized lives.

My essays are schematic and thematic reading guides to Pali Buddhist scripture. Our studies are programmatic and purpose driven. We don't imagine what we should think about what a Buddha thought. Instead we ask why Gods begged Buddha to speak his wisdom and why thousands flocked to his voluntary Sangha training monastic communities before he died at age 83 of bad pork. Why have so many repurpossed Buddha's teachings even today? Why were these claims radical and new? Who denies them that we must still access them specially?

Any cross references are for further reading and do not lay claim to veracity on the backs of patient scholars. These are non-comprehensive onramp reading guides for lifelong wisdom seekers finding tall shade trees in Buddhist Dhamma. All mistakes are mine.
