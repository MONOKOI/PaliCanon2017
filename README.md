_Essays On Ecumenical Classical Roads Accessing Buddha Dhamma_

I arranged a Woodley Park, DC Pali Canon Meetup.com reading group May, 2017. This Group Combines the translator Bikkhu Bodhi's _In The Buddha's Words_ With Gombrich's _What The Buddha Thought_ and Stoic philosophy represented by Marcus Aurelius' _Meditations_ And Epictetus' _Enchiridion_. The last selection was studied by centures of early Greek Or Latin literate Christians With _Jesus_ Substituted For _Socrates_.

An overt thesis we explore is that lived Eurasian literate traditions overlapped between Philosophical Schools traveling the Silk Road. They shared letters, lectures, dialogs, manuscripts, logic and numeric methods between Asia, the Indian Subcontinent and Europe. That forms an overlapping _Heartwood_ Or _Ganges_ unbroken intellectual tradition that Christian Westerners today inherit.

These essays are schematic and thematic reading guides to Pali Buddhist scripture. Our studies are programmatic and purpose driven. We don't imagine what we should think about what a Buddha thought. Instead we ask why Gods begged Buddha to speak his wisdom and why thousands flocked to his voluntary Sangha training monastic communities before he died at age 83 of bad pork.

Any cross references are for further reading and do not lay claim to veracity on the backs of patient scholars. These are non-comprehensive onramp reading guides for lifelong wisdom seekers finding tall shade trees in Buddhist Dhamma. All mistakes are mine.
