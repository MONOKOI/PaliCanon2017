# How Scriptures Work

## Patterns

1. _Climbing Ropes_. Books are products of human traditions before us. Scriptural traditions are close to climbing ropes left behind by climbers of tall treacherous Mountains of Spirit. We share Scriptural traditions climbing those mountains together. Picture knots in those ropes as chapters or books. Picture resting places up those Mountains schools of focus maintained over generations.  

1. _Dumpster Diving Guides_. Scriptural traditions are books, fragments, anthologies and translations. Those human traditions leave behind vast libraries. Most of our libraries and entertainment fatigued minds are filled with junk single editions of fictions, textbooks and nothing memorable, useful or important. Not everything important is already written or written by the most famous names. But enduring traditions let us harvest the best from intellectual dumps all human beings inherit.

1. _Tallest Growing Deepest Rooted Forest Trees_. 

1. _Caravans Between Desert Oases_. 

1. _Error Correcting Combs_. Combs pick nits and tangles our of hair.

1. _Cultivating Yeast_. Yeast makes grapes ferment and wheat flour rise.

1. _Generative Notations_. 


## Anti Patterns

1. _Not Teams_. Historians brand teams in retrospect or gathering new schools. That can be instructive or generative. But we are not picking teams. We pick foci and follow roads from there.

1. _Not Delusions_. We are not invited to inhabit visual dreamy delusions of spirit realms or after lives. We share reading, questioning and applying terrestrial human teachings we inherit.
